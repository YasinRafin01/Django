# Property Information Management System

This Django application manages property information using Django admin. It allows for storing and managing property details, including images, locations, and amenities.

## Features

- Django-based property management system
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Django ORM for database operations
- Django Admin interface for CRUD operations
- CLI application for data migration from Scrapy project

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- psycopg2 (PostgreSQL adapter for Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YasinRafin01/Django
   cd Django-main
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Database Configuration:

1. For Django Database configuration following steps required
   - Open Terminal and type
     ```
     nano ~/.pg_service.conf
     ```
   - Then put the following configuration, Save and exit
     ```
     [my_service]
     host=localhost
     user=postgres
     dbname= your_database_name
     port= your_port_number
     password= your_password
     ```
2. For Scrapy Databse Connection go to projects config.py and edit the following:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://username:your_password@localhost:port_number/database_name"
   
   ```
## Run Migrations:

   - In the  project run migrations
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
## Data Transfer from Scrapy Database To Django Database through CLI:
   
   1. Run the following command to transfer the existing datas from scrapy database
      ```
      python manage.py migrate_scrapy_data
      ```
   2. As there was no field for Amenities in the Scrapy database I have put another option to fetch Amenities from the website and put it into our Django database of the corresponding hotel for that run the following command:
      ```
      python manage.py update_amenities
      ```
   3. After doing this our images will be stored automatically in a file named `media`. You can go there and check the downloaded images.
      
## CRUD Operation:
   All our datas are now stored in the database. For CRUD operation follow the steps:
   1. First create a superuser by following command:
      ```
      python manage.py createsuperuser
      ```
  2. After creating the superuser do the following:
    - Start the Django development server:
         ```
          python manage.py runserver
         ```
    - Access the Django Admin interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with your superuser credentials.
    - Use the Admin interface to manage property information, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting properties, locations, and amenities.
